# tkinter_recorder

This is the README.md file for the tkinter_recorder project I built using the tkinter library and the sqlite which is to my understanding a SQL flavor.

For best use: 
1. Create a record by filling in the boxes
2. Afterwards click on the "Add Record to Database" button, this in turn will create a db called addresses_book.db
3. Click on "Show Records" button, and it will show the records, please note that the ID number is on the far right side.
4. You can either delete or an update a record but for this you'll have to supply the record ID number, just type it in the "ID Number" box.
5. if you choose to update, a new window will pop in, change the field you are interested in, and then click the "Save Record" button to save the changes.

That is it, I hope you enjoy.
